paddlefish metapopulation viability analysis

This program allows the user to explore the drivers of source-sink metapopulation dynamics of migratory fish in a reservoir chain.
By toggling the demographic rates (MA, MJ, and R) and the amount of exchange between reservoirs (pup and pdown), 
the user should be able to stabilize the metapopulations such that none of the reservoirs crash.
